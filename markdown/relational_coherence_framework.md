# Relational Coherence Framework (RCF)
## A Four-Channel Compatibility Specification (CESV)

**Version:** 1.3.0 • **Status:** Stable • **Type:** Diagnostic & Triage Tool

---

## Abstract

Romantic relationships are commonly evaluated using an overloaded label: **chemistry**. That term collapses multiple separable variables into one signal, producing predictable errors:

- **False positives:** Early intensity is treated as long-term compatibility.
- **Late failures:** Structural mismatches are discovered after investment and entanglement.

This document specifies a **four-channel model** that decomposes chemistry into distinct, measurable components. It is a **diagnostic tool**, not a repair manual: it identifies structural capacity, constraints, and failure points to enable informed decision-making.

**The Four Channels (CESV):**
1. **Cognitive (C)** — joint sensemaking, intellectual respect, joint problem-solving (*Mind*)
2. **Emotional (E)** — emotional safety, attunement, repair capacity (*Safety*)
3. **Somatic (S)** — physical attraction, nervous system compatibility, embodied ease (*Body*)
4. **Vector (V)** — shared direction, values under tradeoff, future trajectory (*Trajectory*)

## 0) Scope, Non-Goals, and Guardrails

### 0.1 Scope
- Applies to **pair-bond romantic relationships** (dating through long-term partnership).
- Supports: diagnosis, risk estimation, decision hygiene, communication legibility.

### 0.2 Non-Goals
- Not therapy, not a moral framework, not a guarantee of predictability.
- Does not prescribe how to repair a channel; it specifies how to **measure** and **decide**.

### 0.3 Anti-Weaponization Rule
- Scores are valid only as **first-person reporting** ("my experience of this channel"), not as verdicts imposed on another person.
- If scoring becomes coercive or argumentative, the system is already failing on **legibility/exit** (see §1.3).
- The framework diagnoses systems, not people.

---

## 1) Core Definitions

### 1.1 Channel vs. Outcome
- A **channel** is a type of connection (C, E, S, V).
- An **outcome** is what the relationship produces over time: stability, intimacy, resilience, conflict load.

Strong channels can still produce poor outcomes if misaligned or unconstrained by clear terms.

### 1.2 Amplitude vs. Alignment
Each channel has two independent properties:
- **Amplitude:** Strength of connection ("How much capacity exists?")
- **Alignment:** Directional compatibility ("Does it point the same way for both people?")

High amplitude + low alignment behaves like a weak channel in practice.
Example: both enjoy debate (high C amplitude), but one experiences disagreement as play while the other experiences it as disrespect (low C alignment).

### 1.3 Legibility & Uncertainty
A relationship is **legible** when:
- Expectations are stated as **terms** (not implied narratives).
- Boundaries and constraints are explicit enough to evaluate.
- There is a **real exit**: ability to pause, refuse, or leave **without punishment**.

**Unbounded Uncertainty:** A state where terms are ambiguous, stakes are high, and the next action cannot be justified without guesswork. This is the inverse of legibility.

### 1.4 Coherence (Operational Definition)
**Relational coherence** is the system's ability to maintain alignment and function under perturbation: conflict, stress, life changes, distance, temptation, novelty loss.

Coherence requires:
- Adequate amplitude in necessary channels
- Adequate alignment in those channels
- Legible terms + real exit
- Repair loops that close

---

## 2) The Model

### 2.1 Channel Roles (Systems View)
- **E (Emotional) is error-correction:** Low E turns mistakes into permanent damage. E enables the other three channels to function.
- **V (Vector) is the direction:** Low V makes investment directionless; tradeoffs fracture the system.
- **C and S are quality-of-life structure:** They shape daily experience and attraction stability.

### 2.2 Default Drift
In the absence of active maintenance, channels drift toward specific failure states. Drift is not fate; it is the default behavior of unmaintained systems.

| Channel | The Drift | Counter-Measure |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **C** | Curiosity → Logistics/Admin ("manager mode") | Novelty injection; new shared problems |
| **E** | Friction → Unresolved debt (grievance accumulation) | Active repair loops; closing cycles |
| **S** | Novelty → Habituation (desire baseline drops) | Intentional cultivation; polarity maintenance |
| **V** | Alignment → Divergence (individual growth) | Periodic recalibration; explicit trajectory conversations |

### 2.3 Channel Interaction Matrix
Channels are separable but coupled. Use this table for differential diagnosis: "Is C failing because of C, or because E is gating it?"

*Note: Matrix entries are heuristic couplings, not universal causal laws.*

**When Strong (+):**

| Source | → C | → E | → S | → V |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **C+** | — | Reduces conflict load (if E adequate) | Indirect (shared projects can spark interest) | Enables clearer negotiation |
| **E+** | Dialogue stays safe; reduces "logic warfare" | — | Relaxation enables desire | Hard conversations stay possible |
| **S+** | Smooths friction via bonding | Reinforces safety (non-verbal repair) | — | Embodied "we" strengthens commitment |
| **V+** | Shared purpose focuses C | Adversity feels shared, not adversarial | Meaning sustains desire through novelty loss | — |

**When Weak (−):**

| Source | → C | → E | → S | → V |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **C−** | — | Decisions become fights | Frustration spills into distance | V conversations fail to converge |
| **E−** | Logic becomes warfare | — | Anxiety suppresses desire | V discussions trigger defensiveness |
| **S−** | No direct effect | Loneliness/rejection risk | — | Doubt about relationship viability |
| **V−** | Planning feels pointless | Resentment from unclear purpose | "Why bother" attitude | — |

**Key Insight:** E is the substrate. Low E corrupts interventions in C, S, and V.

## 3) Scoring and Decision Outputs

### 3.1 Scoring Anchors (0–5)
| Score | Label | Operational Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 0–1 | **Critical** | Active pain, avoidance, or hostility. The channel is a liability. |
| 2–3 | **Functional** | Works when conditions are easy; breaks under stress. Maintenance required. |
| 4–5 | **Generative** | Produces energy rather than consuming it. Flow state. |

### 3.2 Scoring Mechanics
1. **Channel Score (per person):** min(my_amplitude, my_alignment)
2. **Relationship Channel Score:** min(Person A's score, Person B's score)
3. **Delta:** |Person A's score − Person B's score|
4. **RC_min (Conservative Coherence):** min(C_rel, E_rel, S_rel, V_rel)

### 3.3 The Delta Rule (Reality Gap)
| Delta | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 0–1 | Legible | Normal variance in perception |
| 2 | Caution | Investigate—possible communication gap or early masking |
| 3+ | Illegible | Reality gap. Do not optimize the relationship; resolve perception gap first. |

### 3.4 The Min Rule
For any relationship-level score, use the lower of the two partners' scores. The partner experiencing the deficit defines the constraint.

### 3.5 Conservative Coherence Estimate
**RC_min = min(C_rel, E_rel, S_rel, V_rel)**
This models the relationship as a series system: the weakest channel limits overall stability.



### 3.6 Default Acceptance Thresholds
For long-term partnership goals:
- **E_rel ≥ 3** (repair capacity is non-optional)
- **V_rel ≥ 3** (direction conflicts compound over time)

C and S thresholds depend on relationship type and explicit terms.

### 3.7 Decision Outputs
Given legibility status and scores, the diagnostic outputs one of four actions:

**1. PROCEED**
- Legibility present, exit real
- E_rel ≥ 3 and V_rel ≥ 3
- No Delta ≥ 3

**2. PROCEED WITH CONSTRAINTS**
- Legible terms exist to contain known mismatches
- Delta ≤ 2 on all channels
- RC_min may be < 3, but both parties explicitly accept the constraint

**3. BRAKE (Regress to Terms)**
- Legibility degraded OR **unbounded uncertainty** detected
- Delta ≥ 3 on any channel
- Action: Pause → Restate terms → Re-measure
- *Note:* BRAKE includes safety overrides when exit is not currently safe.

**4. EXIT**
- Exit is punished / coercion present
- One partner has a non-negotiable constraint at 0–1 (deal-breaker)
- V alignment fails at an irreversible tradeoff

### 3.8 Measurement Cadence
| Phase | Trigger | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Dating | Event-triggered | V after ~3 months; C after travel; E after first real conflict |
| Established | Calendar-triggered | Quarterly review; attention to V drift and S maintenance |
| Crisis | Triage-triggered | Weekly E assessment until repair capacity stabilizes |

### 3.9 Intervention Priority
1. **E first (repair capacity):** Without E, you cannot safely address anything else.
2. **V second (direction):** If E is stable, verify you're building the same thing.
3. **C and S third (quality):** Tractable only when E and V are stable.

**Exception:** If S=0 is a known deal-breaker, V clarity (acceptability) must precede E repair.

## 4) Channel Specifications

### 4.1 Cognitive (C): "Do decisions get easier together?"
**High C:** Conversations generate insight/action; shared standards for reasoning; planning improves with two minds; intellectual respect.
**Low C:** Chronic overexplaining; decision avoidance; one partner becomes "Manager"; repeated operational failures.
**Stress Test:** Introduce a real constraint (budget, travel). Observe convergence vs. spiral.

### 4.2 Emotional (E): "Can the system repair?"
**High E:** Honesty without punishment; vulnerability met with care; conflict ends with repair; nervous system safety.
**Low E:** Eggshells, stonewalling, silent treatment, retaliation; issue recycling; emotional performance required for stability.
**Primary Metric:** Repair speed and quality.

### 4.3 Somatic (S): "Do bodies choose each other consistently?"
**Somatic** denotes embodied interaction: attraction, touch, sex, co-regulation, felt ease.
**High S:** Mutual desire/initiation; touch is natural; sex is connection; proximity reduces anxiety.
**Low S:** Transactional sex; affection is polite; attraction exists only under novelty; proximity increases anxiety.

**Note:** High emotional closeness with low S is typically companionship unless terms explicitly reclassify the relationship.

### 4.4 Vector (V): "Are both building the same life?"
**High V:** Shared values survive tradeoffs; compatible "good life" definition; congruent stance toward responsibility; shared trajectory.
**Low V:** High present-day enjoyment with no target; future conversations trigger avoidance; recurring identity negotiation.
**Why V Fails Late:** V is revealed by tradeoffs (location, money, kids), not vibes.

## 5) Pattern Library
Each pattern includes: signature, failure mode, next action, and diagnostic question.



### Pattern A — Spark Loop
**Signature:** S high, E low, V low/unknown
**Failure Mode:** Intensity substitutes for repair; rupture debt accumulates.
**Next Action:** Measure E via conflict + repair cycle; confirm exit is real.
**Diagnostic:** "After conflict, do issues resolve—or does intimacy reset without repair?"

### Pattern B — Best-Friend Trap
**Signature:** C high, E high, S low
**Failure Mode:** Companionship misclassified as romance; silent resentment or temptation risk.
**Next Action:** Set explicit terms for S expectations; compute deal-breakers.
**Diagnostic:** "Is desire mutual, or is the bond primarily conversational/emotional?"

### Pattern C — Debate + Desire
**Signature:** C high, S high, E low
**Failure Mode:** Analysis substitutes for care; vulnerability becomes unsafe.
**Next Action:** Measure E repair protocol; check for retaliation/stonewalling.
**Diagnostic:** "When hurt appears, does comfort occur—or justification/correction?"

### Pattern D — Mission Partnership
**Signature:** V high, C high, E low/medium
**Failure Mode:** Output without intimacy; loneliness inside success.
**Next Action:** Measure E as felt safety; verify non-punitive exit.
**Diagnostic:** "Is there emotional home, or only shared projects?"

### Pattern E — Comfort Without Direction
**Signature:** E high, S medium/high, V low
**Failure Mode:** Fractures at commitment thresholds (move, marriage, kids, money).
**Next Action:** Force an expensive tradeoff conversation early; assess V alignment.
**Diagnostic:** "Can both state a 3–5 year trajectory without avoidance?"

### Pattern F — Caretaker System
**Signature:** E high, C low/misaligned
**Failure Mode:** Competence imbalance converts romance into supervision.
**Next Action:** Test operational reliability with shared planning; check consent on roles.
**Diagnostic:** "If management stops, does life degrade rapidly?"

### Pattern G — Aligned Future, Misaligned Bodies
**Signature:** V high, E medium/high, S low
**Failure Mode:** Stability with private frustration; temptation or resentment risk.
**Next Action:** Make S terms explicit; decide accept vs. exit (no denial).
**Diagnostic:** "Are both consenting to the actual intimacy pattern—or pretending?"

### Pattern H — High-Coherence Pair
**Signature:** C high, E high, S high, V high
**Failure Mode:** Typically exogenous (timing, health, external constraints).
**Next Action:** Monitor drift; recalibrate V periodically.
**Diagnostic:** "Under stress, does coordination increase or fragmentation increase?"

### Pattern I — Entropy Drift
**Signature:** Was high across channels, now declining (typically E and S first)
**Failure Mode:** **Default drift** not countered with active maintenance.
**Next Action:** Identify when drift started; restore legibility; measure E repair.
**Diagnostic:** "When did interactions become mostly obligation/admin?"

## 6) Operational Protocols

### 6.1 Decision Loop
**OBSERVE → FRAME → TERMS → CHECK → COMMIT → EXECUTE → REVIEW**
*(If legibility collapses: **BRAKE**)*

- **OBSERVE:** Collect behaviors and constraints (not narratives).
- **FRAME:** Propose the simplest accurate interpretation (testable hypothesis).
- **TERMS:** State expectations, boundaries, exit conditions.
- **CHECK:** Verify legibility + channel scores under real scenarios.
- **COMMIT:** Choose investment level that matches evidence.
- **EXECUTE:** Run the commitment level under constraints; observe outcomes.
- **REVIEW:** Update based on outcomes, not hopes.

### 6.2 Brake Protocol (3-Step Regression)
When uncertainty is unbounded, stakes are high, or exit is being punished:

1. **Return to Terms:** Restore legibility (restate constraints, boundaries, resolution criteria).
2. **Activate Exit (if needed):** Take space, slow commitment, or disengage without retaliation.
3. **Safety Override:** If exit is unsafe, halt diagnostic and seek external support. (Safety supersedes protocol.)

### 6.3 Terms Template
Legible terms answer these questions:
1. **What is this?** (Relationship type, exclusivity, commitment level)
2. **What does each person need?** (Non-negotiable requirements per channel)
3. **What breaks it?** (Explicit deal-breakers, stated not implied)
4. **How do we exit?** (What clean disengagement looks like)

## 7) Failure Modes (Diagnostic Vocabulary)

| Mode | Description | Signature |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Story Override | Narrative replaces explicit terms; ambiguity masquerades as romance | V unknown, terms absent |
| Capture | Exit is punished; consent degrades | E low, coercion present |
| Unrepaired Rupture | Conflict cycles repeat; debt accumulates | E low/misaligned |
| Intensity Substitution | S masks E; intimacy used as reset without repair | S high, E low |
| Manager Drift | One partner becomes operator; romance collapses into supervision | C low/misaligned |
| Future Collision | Choices reveal incompatible direction | V low alignment |
| Companionship Mislabel | Romance expected from system functioning as companionship | S low, terms unclear |
| Reality Gap | Partners score the relationship differently (Delta ≥ 3) | Any channel, high Delta |
| Entropy Drift | Gradual decay from lack of maintenance | All channels declining |
